# U.S. Airline Flights Delay & Cancellations Analysis (2015)

Data Source: https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground/airline-flight-delays

Records for 5,000,000+ commercial airline flights in 2015, compiled for the U.S. DOT Air Travel Consumer Report. Each record represents a single flight, including the airline name, flight number, origin/destination airport and flight distance, as well as scheduled/actual departure and arrival times.

# Project Overview

This project analyzes the U.S. domestic flight dataset for 2015, focusing on flight delays, cancellations, and airline performance.

The goal was to identify patterns and insights around:

    Seasonal and weekly flight volumes
    
    Departure delays and their severity
    
    Airport and airline reliability
    
    Cancellations and their causes

Through exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn), we highlight operational inefficiencies and uncover trends that impact both airlines and passengers.

# Tools & Skills Used

    Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
    
    Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, filtering cancellations, converting time formats
    
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Aggregations, group-bys, visualizations
    
    Airline Industry Knowledge: Delay classifications, cancellation codes interpretation

# Visualizations

    The analysis produced:
    
    Bar charts of flight volume by month & day of week
    
    Line plots of % delays across months
    
    Histograms of departure delays
    
    Bar charts of cancellation reasons
    
    Airline performance comparison plots

These visualizations make trends and problem areas easy to identify.


# Business & Passenger Impact

    Airlines: Can use insights to improve scheduling buffers, crew management, and weather preparedness.
    
    Airports: Can allocate resources (gates, staff) around seasonal surges.
    
    Passengers: Helps in planning â€” avoiding risky airports/seasons, selecting more reliable airlines.


# Project Learnings

    Handling large datasets with Pandas efficiently.
    
    Interpreting domain-specific codes (e.g., cancellation reasons).
    
    Turning EDA into actionable insights.

# Next Steps

    Future improvements could include:
    
    Machine Learning: Predicting delays using weather + schedule features.
    
    Network Analysis: Studying hub airports and their cascading effects on delays.
    
    Interactive Dashboards: Deploying results on Power BI / Tableau / Streamlit.
